# Welcome to my 'Project McNulty' repo!   

For this project at Metis, I used supervised learning (classification), Amazon Web Services, PostGreSQL, Flask, and D3 to create a web app that consolidates data on housing throughout the city. Users can find information on complaints about the building and area, crime rates, as well as the 'Sketchy Landlord' index, created by a classification model trained on data where tenants ended up suing their landlords.

In this repo, I've uploaded my code, the data I used, and the presentation I gave at Metis on this project.
